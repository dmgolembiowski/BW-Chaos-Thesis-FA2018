Research Topics?
1.) Why does the number of limits change for the logistic chaos function?

2.) What condition(s) must be met for the number of limits to change?
    Alternatively, what are the numerical thresholds, if any, that cause the number of limits (for some r-value)
    to, for example, change from 3 limits to 6 limits?

3.) What types of plots can be used? How could we generate them?


Direct Suggestions:
1.) Compile a catalog for values of 'r' such that the behavior of Xn+1(r) can be known.
2.) Devise informative or intuitively-insightful graphics to show Xn+1's behavior as a function of r.
3.) Discover new things.
4.) Use visuals/computer programs as a tool for writing rigorous proofs--the true goal.
